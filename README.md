## üîç Project Overview

### 1. `AI using Agentic AI.ipynb`
Builds an agent-style AI that can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously using tool integrations.

### 2. `Code_Generation_Model_with_LLMs.ipynb`
A demonstration of how LLMs can generate working code from natural language prompts. Includes best practices and prompt optimization.

### 3. `End_to_End_Chatbot.ipynb`
Complete pipeline for building an AI chatbot ‚Äî from prompt design to deployment-ready interfaces.

### 4. `Generative AI Model.ipynb`
Explores use of LLMs for creative content generation ‚Äî including stories, images (via prompts), and contextual expansion.

### 5. `LLM .ipynb`
General experiments and utilities using LLMs ‚Äî API calls, embeddings, summarization, and interactive testing.
